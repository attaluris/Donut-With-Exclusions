# Donut-With-Exclusions

Description:
this is basically donut, except it allows you to more easily exclude pairing (like how we don't want people in the same team to be with each other); no Slack integration yet though!

Directions for how to use this file
1. Go onto https://trinket.io/python/f7ad7f9864
2. before the first chum of the semester, initialize the history list with just the people in each person's team
3. run the code --> it should print out the chums and also a new history
4. copy and paste the history that's printed out into the history in the code and save the entire thing for next week's run
5. repeat next week
